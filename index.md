# Advanced Compiler Design (CSE 231)


<a href="https://jpolitz.github.io">Joe Gibbs Politz</a> (Instructor)

## Course Summary

The main course project is building an in-browser, interactive compiler from
(typed) Python programs to WebAssembly.

This project will allow us to explore a number of interesting features of
compilation and build deployable, user-facing programming environments.

Weekly lectures will be a mix of practical tutorials on necessary tools and
techniques, discussions of compilers concepts that we can apply to our
projects, and review of solutions generated by the class.

We will also assign weekly readings from around the Web highlighting tools
and techniques we need, and research papers that explore the space of
compiler design.

## Grading

- 10% Weekly review quizzes
- 30% Three two-week programming projects
- 60% One open-ended project (with milestones/parts, full rubric)

## Getting Help

Joe and Yousef have office hours where you can join a Zoom room and get a mix
of one-on-one and group help (depending on your question):

- Joe: Wednesday 2-3pm [https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/politz](https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/politz)
- Yousef: TBD

You can also post questions to the course message board, which you will get
an invite to along with the first lecture. If you need anything in the
meantime, you can email Joe at jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu.
